Comparison of novel gradient tracking methods for distributed optimization for real world application

In this project, we want to compare the convergence results of two novel gradient tracking method based algorithms for distributed multi agent optimization for big data applications. We considered distributed logistic regression for classification in this study. With regularization, the problem is a smooth, strongly convex. The two algorithms under study are the DSGT and SONATA for undirected graph variant. We use two high dimensional data sets for our study, MNIST and synthetic data. The optimization was run for different network settings and the results have been presented.
